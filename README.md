# Iguazio and MLOps - DATASCI 290

This repo is a companion to the guest lecture at UC Berkeley for the DATASCI 290 class. It includes the slides as well as Iguazio implementations for each of the design patterns.

### 1. Abstractions to Containerize Code/Model
Automatically package up a piece of code or model and run on a cluster at scale.

### 2. CI/CD and Git as Source of Truth
Use CI/CD and infrastructure as code to orchestrate workloads. Use the Git repo as the source of truth.

### 3. Feature Store as a Hub for ML
Use a feature store for more than ingesting and retrieving features - integrate with experiment tracking, model serving, and model monitoring.

### 4. Monitoring Drift + Automated Re-Training
Monitor feature drift and automate the re-training process to prevent model decay over time.
